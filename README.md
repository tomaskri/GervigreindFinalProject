Meeting with Ana 8/11/2022:

Questions: Which data to select?

Use the free data. Start with one city and test it on same city and eval on another city. She believes that the features match up, she will check it for us.

Maybe thinking of moving towards SVR before NN?

YES thats a great strategy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I would start with chosing the most valuable features. Size, bedrooms, location. Start without location, just area, no. of bedrooms, just the very simple features. 

Remember to convert currency correctly when evaluating.


Importante featurae!!
